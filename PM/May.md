As I will move to another country and start a new position. I will creat the monthly plan differently from the previous ones. 

Addtionally, I would like to try out two practises for "effective action planning", which are
1. Write down the vision
2. Assess potential threats and limitations

in this month and check how they will improve my performance. 

Visions
1. Everything gets prepared for traving to the new country
2. Get prepared for the new position
3. Good farewell to families, friends, teachers, and colleagues

Threats: 
1. Prepared too much for courses. I might fail to make them at the end --> Try to prioritize them
2. Get stressed by the work --> Prioritize them, get the high priority tasks done first,  and delegate to others
3. Propably get emotianals for leaving the family; get scaried to move to a new country; get worried about the future --> Meditation if necesary; Believe that everything will be better than 2021.
