This file records the plan for February, 2023. 

Based on the experience of Janurary, weekly plan is difficult to track and consumes much time on the management. 
Therefore, in February, monthly-plan will be tried out. The result will be recorded at the end of the month. 


| Catalog  | Key Results |  Review | Retrospective | Actions  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| STEM  | 1. Convex Optimization (55 lectures)  2. CSAPP(26 lectures) 3. Distributed System (Book) | 1. [Convex Optimization (Lecture 1 ~ 40)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jt411p7jE?p=39&spm_id_from=pageDriver&vd_source=b2f9d3cbfd56f4dc70d5865866121bbf), 2 and 3 nearly no progress  | Optimization has higher priority than others; The goal is too ambitious  | Continue the optimization courses, and leave some buffer in planning |
| EDUCATION |  |  Create a Org in github to share techniques and research | Very good initiative  | Keep doing that |
| OR  | 1. Guns, Germs, and Steel 2. 天文百科 （月球）3. 经济学原理 4. Dancing 5. Gym and Running  | 1. Chapter 8 2. No progress 3. Chapter 4 Dancing (14 times) 5 Gym (6 + battle wave) and Running (11 times) | 1. Guns, germs, and steel touch many subjects, should leave more time on it.  2. Good job in dancing and workout | Should target on knowledge rather than how fast you finish the reading |

In addition to the planned work, I have also done: 
1. Started learning optimization tools: pyomo
2. Read book "始于极限"
3. Start reading book "像外行一样思考像专家一样实践"
4. Get to know "Vehicular Edge Computing"
5. Create a Org in github to share techniques and research

Lesson learnt: 
1. Leave some buffer for courses and books
2. Take notes when reading interesting books, e.g., Guns, Germs, and Steel
3. Don't exhuast yourself in gym like "Battle Wave"
4. Develop a good habbit, like regular exercise, is much more important than setting an unrealistic goal and getting disappointed while failing it.
