Monthly check worked well in Feb, 2023. Therefore, I will continue it in this month.

| STEM  | 1. [Convex Optimization (41-55 lectures)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jt411p7jE?p=39&spm_id_from=pageDriver&vd_source=b2f9d3cbfd56f4dc70d5865866121bbf) 2. [Convex optimization from Boyd (13 lectures)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pg4y187Ed/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=b2f9d3cbfd56f4dc70d5865866121bbf) 3. Read Convex optimization book 4. Do the homework in convex optimization book 5. Get familiar with pyomo and related algorithms 6. Write a blog to show the optimization-based scheduling, including literature review, implementation, comparison| 1. Done 2. Not start 3. No 4. No 5. No 6. No  | After finishing the first course of convex optimization, I replanned our study path, and started to learn [linear algebra](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1a7411M7wH/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=b2f9d3cbfd56f4dc70d5865866121bbf) and [concrete optimization](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1z84y1h7M1/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=b2f9d3cbfd56f4dc70d5865866121bbf), SMT for current research project  | The learning plan probably can be adjust during the cicle  |
| EDUCATION | Keep updating [CSWaterProof Org](https://github.com/CSWaterProof)  | Learn new tech, optimization and federated learning, but did not push the code  |  The structure for tech is not clear | Define a clear structure, then update it accordinngly |
| OR  | 1. Continue read "Guns, Germs, and Steel" and create a mind-map to show the information 2. watch [documentary of "Guns, Germs, and Steel"](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1584y11719/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=b2f9d3cbfd56f4dc70d5865866121bbf) 3. Read book "像外行一样思考像专家一样实践" 4. Listen to audio book "经济学原理 " 5. Dancing (Jazz Funk, rhythm, coordination) 6. Gym and Running| 1. Not continued 2. Done 3. read a bit, but it is not a good book to read 4. Not continued 5. No dancing 6. Done | Vacation to Changbaishan; Feel like the music makes me uncalm; Start to try musical theather, like Mozart, l'opéra rock; | There is a need to discuss whether I should stick to monthly plan or adust it dynamically|

In addition to the planned work, I have also done: 
1. Start to learn linear algebra
2. Start to learn concreate optimization
3. Learn boolean satisfiability and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT); Try to define a mathmatical model
4. Lonely Planet America in Pudong library; Bauhaus in Xuhui library
5. Learn federated learning a bit
6. Get to know the global economy and GPT
7. Read poem
8. Read book Le Mythe de Syspthe (Albert Camus)
9. Watch music theater "Mozart, l'opéra rock" and get to know new type of music
10. Make a good friend and start to learn how to build an healty and warm intimate relationship, this time, it is friendship.

Lesson learnt: 
1. Time should be well estimated when planning
2. Don't be greedy in learning. 
3. Keep reflection when builing an healty intimate relationship
4. It is OK to have an overarching goal, and work for that. But you should also be flexiable in when to achieve it and how.  
5. To fight for a dream, it requires courage and persistence and not everyone have them. Please stop worrying about the outcome.
