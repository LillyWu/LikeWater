# LikeWater

## Objective
This is a repository for ***Fun, fUn, and fuN!***

## Structure
The Top Level Directories: **STEM, EDUCATION, and MUSIC**, are professions that I target to develop. 

The directories under **OR** are new SPACES that I would like to start or continue the exploration.

The directory **PM** is for management based on the concept of Agile and OKR (Too personal, it can be skipped while wandering this repository).
